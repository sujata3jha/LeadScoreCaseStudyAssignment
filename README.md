Lead Score case study

Problem statement:

An education company named X Education sells online courses to industry professionals. On any given day, many professionals who are interested in the courses land
on their website and browse for courses. When these people fill up a form providing their email address or phone number, they are classified to be a lead.
Once these leads are acquired, employees from the sales team start making calls, writing emails, etc. Through this process, some of the leads get converted while most do not.
Now, although X Education gets a lot of leads, its lead conversion rate is very poor.Build a logistic regression model to assign a lead score between 0 and 100 to each of
the leads which can be used by the company to target potential leads. A higher score would mean that the lead is hot, i.e. is most likely to convert whereas a lower 
score would mean that the lead is cold and will mostly not get converted.

Objective
To build a logistic model which helps to identify the potential buyers for X Education company.
